# 🃏 Card Game Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Card Game Project**—a Python-based deck simulation designed for dynamic card interactions. Whether you're building a full-fledged card game or just exploring object-oriented programming concepts, this project provides an interactive and engaging foundation. The deck consists of standard suits and ranks, complete with shuffling and dealing functionality.

## Features
✔️ **Object-Oriented Design** – Well-structured `Card` and `Deck` classes  
✔️ **Shuffling & Dealing** – Randomized shuffling and automated card dealing  
✔️ **Correct Deck Generation** – Uses both suits and ranks accurately  
✔️ **Scalability** – Easily expandable for advanced gameplay  

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3** – Core programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive execution
- **random module** – Efficient deck shuffling  

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sundaram-23/cardgame.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd cardgame
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```sh
   python cardgame.py
   ```

## Usage Example
Here’s how to use the `Deck` class in your Python script:
```python
from cardgame import Deck

# Create and shuffle the deck
deck = Deck()
deck.shuffle()

# Deal a card
card = deck.deal()
print(f"Dealt card: {card}")
```

## Improvements & Future Enhancements
🔹 **GUI Support** – Implement a graphical interface for interactive play  
🔹 **Multiplayer Mode** – Add support for multiple users  
🔹 **Advanced Rules** – Introduce unique game mechanics
